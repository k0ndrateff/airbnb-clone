# Fullstack AirBnB Clone

This is a fullstack pet-project that I do in my free time. 

Main framework for this project is Next.js 13. The database for the backend is MongoDB, and querying is realised 
with Prisma.

Project is not completed and is subject to change.

You can run demo by cloning this repository and running:

```shell
npm run dev
```
